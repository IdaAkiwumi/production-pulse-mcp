⚠️ WHAT THROTTLING/DEPRIORITIZING DOES:
- Reduces the target process's CPU priority (Windows: BELOW_NORMAL, Linux: nice +10)
- Process keeps running but yields CPU to higher-priority work
- Renders complete faster, system stays responsive, thermals stay controlled
- REVERSIBLE: You can restore normal priority later if needed

⚠️ WHEN TO USE:
- Background apps competing with your main render
- Thermal CAUTION state (CPU 75-90%, Temp 75-85°C)
- Not responding to a render farm deadline

⚠️ WHEN NOT TO USE:
- The process IS your main render (throttle something else instead)
- CRITICAL thermal state (use emergency throttle or pause entirely)
